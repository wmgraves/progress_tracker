A simple program for tracking and organizing tasks.

# Description
Progress Tracker is an easy-to-use program for tracking progress for projects. Create individual tasks, set prerequisite requirements, group into categories, and more. Vizualize and export progress data to various file formats (including the .md file that you are currently reading!).

After mostly programming using Java and MATLAB for years, I am working to familiarize myself more with Python. Over the past couple of years, I have had trouble finding a digital task list program or website that offered all of these features without tedious interfaces for free. Instead of trying out a less useful classroom example to learn Python, I decided to learn by creating something I will actually use in the future.

# Requirements
Here is what you need to be able to run this code:
* [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) (2.2)
